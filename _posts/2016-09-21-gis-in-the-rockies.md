I did a thing at a place! Here are my slides from my presentation - _Towards Cartographic Standards for Web-Based Flood Hazard Maps_ - at GIS in the Rockies (and last week at the [2016 Annual CASFM Conference](http://www.casfm.org/annual_conference/2016/annual_conf.htm)).

I'll have a bit more of a writeup on this eventually for anyone interested.
