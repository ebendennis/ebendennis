Since everyone knows the second best thing to maps are charts, here's some charts.

First up, after a January where the sky nearly fell, I wanted to take a look at
how Liverpool's current season stacked up against previous Premier League
seasons. I've pulled all of the weekly point totals going back to 92-93 and
charted them to see where this season stands in comparison. The filled circles
are this season, the line is the average for all seasons, and the shaded area
shows the limits of the upper and lower quintiles.

I also wanted to see if there was any trend around the post-holiday period and
if we actually do tend to underperform, so I took the same data as above, but
plotted it as points per game rather than aggregate.

Finally, I also wanted to check and see how the top 6 was performing relative to
previous seasons. I'm mostly basing this off of the official Premier League
tables, so the later weeks of each season have data points where teams have
games in hand. This only goes back a few seasons right now until I can determine
if there's a better way to aggregate this data by actual matches played instead
of matchweeks. Use the checkboxes to toggle individual positions on/off.
